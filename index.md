I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2027.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 3, Part 1 
This was a favorite because making a calculator to automatically calculate the price of specific sections evenly is useful. We also began to learn how to input information from the users that would atoumacilly input the numbers into the program outputting the results. We can use these aspects of coding to create other prorgrams that would automatically calculate functions to make stuff easier for us.

Lab 7, Part 2
This was a favorite because I enjoyed learning how to implement “and”, “or”, and “not” operators into the coding program. I liked the goal of this lab because this parking program could be something that would be very useful in the real world. Using the these operators can be useful in many different aspects of coding programs that are useful.

Lab 12, Part 1 
This was a favorite because I was able to learn how to create animated images and gifs using GraphicsMagick. In the lab we would use this command to create images and then run a loop command. This allows for the coordinates to change which help the image have a flipbook action. I really enjoyed getting to the end product of this lab because it looked cool.
